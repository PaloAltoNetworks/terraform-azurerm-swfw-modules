# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture. Common NGFW Option

Palo Alto Networks produces several
[validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures),
which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures
guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with
common VM-Series for all traffic; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from
[the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-azurerm-swfw-modules/assets/2110772/aa2ae33a-fb46-4a1c-9811-98ea3b132297)

This code implements:

- a *centralized design*, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound,
  east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the *common option*, which routes all traffic flows onto a single set of VM-Series.

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in
a hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound,
outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Common Option

The common firewall option leverages a single set of VM-Series firewalls. The sole set of firewalls operates as a shared resource
and may present scale limitations with all traffic flowing through a single set of firewalls due to the performance degradation
that occurs when traffic crosses virtual routers. This option is suitable for proof-of-concepts and smaller scale deployments
because the number of firewalls low. However, the technical integration complexity is high.

![Detailed Topology Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/798c4559-f218-4351-b0ee-c0dfb864ad3b)

This reference architecture consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - 4 subnets:
    - 3 of them dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
    - one dedicated to an Application Gateway
  - Route Tables and Network Security Groups
- 2 Load Balancers:
  - public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the firewalls public interfaces, for incoming traffic
  - private - in front of the firewalls private interfaces, for outgoing and east-west traffic
- 2 firewalls:
  - deployed in different zones
  - with 3 network interfaces: management, public, private
  - with public IP addresses assigned to:
    - management interface
    - public interface - due to use of a public Load Balancer this public IP is used mainly for outgoing traffic
- an Application Gateway, serving as a reverse proxy for incoming traffic, with a sample rule setting the XFF header properly
- _(optional)_ test workloads with accompanying infrastructure:
  - 2 Spoke VNETs with Route Tables and Network Security Groups
  - 2 Spoke VMs serving as WordPress-based web servers
  - 2 Azure Bastion managed jump hosts 

**NOTE!**
- In order to deploy the architecture without test workloads described above, empty the `test_infrastructure` map in
  `example.tfvars` file.

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- _(in case of non cloud shell deployment)_ credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud,
  see [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms)).

**NOTE!**
- after the deployment the firewalls remain not configured and not licensed
- this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**, namely the `TFVARS` file can contain
  `bootstrap_options` properties in `var.vmseries` definition. Keep in mind that **this code** is **only an example**.
  It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs
  (take a closer look at the `TODO` markers)
- _(optional)_ authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice
- provide `subscription_id` either by creating an environment variable named `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with Subscription ID as value
  in your shell (recommended option) or by setting the value of `subscription_id` variable within your `tfvars` file (discouraged
  option, we don't recommend putting the Subscription ID in clear text inside the code).
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- _(optional)_ plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  Apply complete! Resources: 53 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:

  lb_frontend_ips = {
    "private" = {
      "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
    "public" = {
      "palo-lb-app1" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  vmseries_mgmt_ips = {
    "fw-1" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-2" = "1.2.3.4"
  }
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

Firewalls in this example are configured with password authentication. To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output usernames
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output passwords
  ```

The management public IP addresses are available in the `vmseries_mgmt_ips`:

```bash
terraform output vmseries_mgmt_ips
```

You can now login to the devices using either:

- cli - ssh client is required
- Web UI (https) - any modern web browser, note that initially the traffic is encrypted with a self-signed certificate.

You can now proceed with licensing and configuring the devices.

Please also refer to [this repository](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for `DAY1` configuration
(security hardening).

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
