# Standalone Panorama Deployment

Panorama is a centralized management system that provides global visibility and control over multiple Palo Alto Networks Next
Generation Firewalls through an easy to use web-based interface. Panorama enables administrators to view aggregate or
device-specific application, user, and content data and manage multiple Palo Alto Networks firewalls â€” all from a central
location.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks Panorama management platform in Azure in management only mode
(without additional logging disks). For option on how to add additional logging disks - please refer to panorama
[module documentation](../../modules/panorama/README.md#input_logging_disks).

## Topology

This is a non zonal deployment. The deployed infrastructure consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - one subnet dedicated to host Panorama appliances
  - a Network Security Group to give access to Panorama's public interface
- a Panorama appliance with a public IP assigned to the management interface

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- _(in case of non cloud shell deployment)_ credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see
  [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto Networks Panorama images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/panorama/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

**Note!**

- after the deployment Panorama remains not licensed and not configured.
- keep in mind that **this code** is **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer
  look at the `TODO` markers)
- _(optional)_ authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice
- provide `subscription_id` either by creating an environment variable named `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with Subscription ID as value
  in your shell (recommended option) or by setting the value of `subscription_id` variable within your `tfvars` file (discouraged
  option, we don't recommend putting the Subscription ID in clear text inside the code).
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- _(optional)_ plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:

  panorama_mgmt_ips = {
    "pn-1" = "1.2.3.4"
  }
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the Panorama to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

Panorama in this example is configured with password authentication. To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output username
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output password
  ```

The management public IP addresses are available in the `panorama_mgmt_ips`:

```bash
terraform output panorama_mgmt_ips
```

You can now login to the devices using either:

- cli - ssh client is required
- Web UI (https) - any modern web browser, note that initially the traffic is encrypted with a self-signed certificate.

You can now proceed with licensing and configuring the devices.

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
