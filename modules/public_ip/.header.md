# Palo Alto Networks Public IP Module for Azure

A Terraform module for deploying Public IP Addresses and Prefixes required for the VM-Series firewalls and other infrastructure
components in Azure.

## Purpose

All other modules that may require a Public IP Address resource support simple creation of it. This module allows more advanced
creation of Public IP Addresses and Prefixes, including:
- Sourcing Public IPs from different Resource Groups than the main resource
- Specifying Availability Zones for Public IPs separately from the main resource
- Specifying Domain Name Label and Idle Timeout for Public IPs
- Allocating Public IP Addresses from an existing Public IP Prefix (e.g. Custom non-Microsoft IP Prefix)

## Usage

For usage please refer to `common_vmseries` reference architecture example.
