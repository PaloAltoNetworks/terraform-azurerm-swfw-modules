# NAT Gateway module

## Purpose
  
Terraform module used to deploy Azure NAT Gateway. For limitations and
zone-resiliency considerations please refer to [Microsoft
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview).
 
This module can be used to either create a new NAT Gateway or to connect
an existing one with subnets deployed using (for example) the [VNET
module](../vnet/README.md).

NAT Gateway is not zone-redundant. It is a zonal resource. It means that it's always deployed in a zone. It's up to the user to
decide if a zone will be specified during resource deployment or if Azure will take that decision for the user. Keep in mind
that regardless of the fact that NAT Gateway is placed in a specific zone it can serve traffic for resources in all zones. But
if that zone becomes unavailable, resources in other zones will lose internet connectivity.

For design considerations, limitation and examples of zone-resiliency architecture please refer to
[Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones).

## Usage

To deploy this resource in it's minimum configuration following code
snippet can be used (assuming that the VNET module is used to deploy VNET
and Subnets):

```hcl
module "natgw" {
  source = "PaloAltoNetworks/swfw-modules/azurerm//modules/natgw"

  name                = "NATGW_name"
  resource_group_name = "resource_group_name"
  location            = "region_name"
  subnet_ids          = { "subnet_name" = "/subscription/xxxx/......." }
  idle_timeout        = 120
}
```

This will create a NAT Gateway in with a single Public IP in a zone chosen
by Azure.
