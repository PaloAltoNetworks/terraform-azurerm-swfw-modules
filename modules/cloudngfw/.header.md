# Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW Module for Azure

A Terraform module for deploying Palo Alto Networks Cloud Next-Generation Firewalls (Cloud NGFW) in Azure. This module supports flexible configurations, allowing the creation of Cloud NGFW resources based on different attachment types and management modes. Additionally, the module provides options to create public IP addresses or use existing ones.

## Usage

This module is designed to work in several *modes* depending on which variables or flags are set. Most common usage scenarios are:

- management_mode = "panorama" & attachment_type ="vnet" - deploys Cloud NGFW attached to a Virtual Hub in a Virtual WAN environment, 
managed via Panorama (using panorama_base64_config). Supports creation or referencing of public IP addresses for connectivity.

```hcl
cloudngfws = {
  "cloudngfw" = {
    name                 = "cloudngfw"
    attachment_type      = "vnet"
    management_mode      = "panorama"
    virtual_network_key  = "cloudngfw-vnet"
    cloudngfw_config = {
      panorama_base64_config     = "" # TODO: Put panorama connection string
    }
  }
}
```
- management_mode = "panorama" & attachment_type ="vhub" - deploys Cloud NGFW attached to a Virtual Hub in a Virtual WAN environment, 
managed via Panorama (using panorama_base64_config). Supports creation or referencing of public IP addresses for connectivity.

```hcl
cloudngfws = {
  "cloudngfw" = {
    name                 = "cloudngfw"
    attachment_type      = "vhub"
    management_mode      = "panorama"
    virtual_wan_key = "virtual_wan"
    virtual_hub_key = "virtual_hub"
    palo_alto_virtual_appliance_name = "cloudngfw-vhub-nva"
    cloudngfw_config = {
      panorama_base64_config     = "" # TODO: Put panorama connection string
    }
  }
}
```

- management_mode = "rulestack" & attachment_type ="vnet" - deploys Cloud NGFW attached to a Virtual Network (VNet) with a local 
rulestack for policy management. Requires VNet-related parameters such as trusted and untrusted subnets, along with the rulestack ID.

```hcl
cloudngfws = {
  "cloudngfw" = {
    name                 = "cloudngfw"
    attachment_type      = "vnet"
    management_mode      = "rulestack"
    virtual_network_key  = "cloudngfw-vnet"
    trusted_subnet_key   = "trusted"
    untrusted_subnet_key = "untrusted"
    cloudngfw_config = {
      rulestack_id               = "" # TODO: Put rulestack ID
    }
  }
}
```

- management_mode = "rulestack" & attachment_type ="vhub" - deploys Cloud NGFW attached to a Virtual Hub in a Virtual WAN environment, 
managed through a local rulestack. Includes options to create or reference public IP addresses.

```hcl
cloudngfws = {
  "cloudngfw" = {
    name                 = "cloudngfw"
    attachment_type      = "vhub"
    management_mode      = "panorama"
    virtual_wan_key = "virtual_wan"
    virtual_hub_key = "virtual_hub"
    palo_alto_virtual_appliance_name = "cloudngfw-vhub-nva"
    cloudngfw_config = {
      rulestack_id               = "" # TODO: Put rulestack ID
    }
  }
}
```
